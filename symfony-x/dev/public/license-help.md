Using **Apache-2.0 licensed code** in your **MIT-licensed project** requires careful attention to both licenses. While both licenses are permissive, the **Apache-2.0 license** has additional requirements that need to be preserved. Here's how you can properly integrate Apache-2.0 code into your MIT project while honoring the attribution requirements and maintaining compatibility:

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Compatibility**:
   - **Apache-2.0 code can be included in an MIT project** as long as you comply with the Apache-2.0 license obligations.
   - However, your project effectively becomes dual-licensed: any part that includes Apache-2.0 code must comply with the Apache-2.0 license.

2. **Your MIT License Stays**:
   - Your original code remains under the MIT license.
   - Only the portions derived from Apache-2.0 must follow its additional requirements.

---

### **Steps to Properly Attribute**
#### 1. **Preserve the Apache-2.0 License**
   - Include the full **Apache-2.0 license text** in your project (e.g., `LICENSE_APACHE` file).
   - Reference it in your main `LICENSE` file.

#### 2. **Document the Use of Apache-2.0 Code**
   - In your project's documentation (e.g., `README.md` or `NOTICE` file), clearly state:
     - Which parts of your project are derived from Apache-2.0 code.
     - Acknowledge the original authors and link to their project.

     Example:
     ```
     Portions of this project are derived from [Project Name], © [Year] [Original Authors].
     Licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See LICENSE_APACHE.
     ```

#### 3. **Include the NOTICE File**
   - If the Apache-2.0 project includes a `NOTICE` file, include it in your project.
   - If you modify the Apache-2.0 code, update the `NOTICE` file to indicate your changes.

#### 4. **Maintain Copyright and License Notices**
   - Retain all copyright, patent, and license notices in the source files you use or modify.
   - Add a comment in your source files indicating the original authors and the license.

     Example in a source file:
     ```javascript
     /*
      * This file includes code from [Project Name].
      * © [Year] [Original Authors].
      * Licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See LICENSE_APACHE for details.
      */
     ```

#### 5. **Dual-License Clarity**
   - In your primary `LICENSE` file (MIT), clarify the dual-license situation.
     Example:
     ```
     This project is licensed under the MIT License.

     However, portions of this project are derived from [Apache-2.0 Project Name],
     © [Year] [Original Authors], and are licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
     See LICENSE_APACHE for details.
     ```

### **Polite Extra Steps**
- **THANKS or CREDITS File**:
  Create a file (e.g., `CREDITS.md`) acknowledging the projects and their contributors.

- **Mention Changes**:
  If you modified the Apache-2.0 code, include a description of the changes either in a `NOTICE` file or your documentation.

---

### **Summary**
By following these steps, you ensure compliance with the Apache-2.0 license while keeping your project under the MIT license. Remember:
- Apache-2.0 code remains under the Apache-2.0 license.
- Your original code can remain MIT-licensed.
- Proper attribution and inclusion of notices are key to honoring both licenses and showing respect for the authors of the code you use.
