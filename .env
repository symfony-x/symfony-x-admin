# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the latter taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files.
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/secrets.html
#
# Run "composer dump-env prod" to compile .env files for production use (requires symfony/flex >=1.2).

# Docker image prefix
# This prefix is dynamically derived from APP_ENV.
# If APP_ENV is set to "dev", IMAGES_PREFIX will resolve to "dev-".
# If APP_ENV is NOT set to "dev", IMAGES_PREFIX will resolve to "sx-".
# This prefix is used in the compose.yaml file to tag and distinguish images for different environments.
